As I've joined the UK rust community it's not been super-clear to me how to join in online. So here's some resources to help you get stuck in.

- <https://www.rust-lang.org/community>
- <https://discord.gg/rust-lang> - this is more about contributing to the Rust language itself rather than just using it, but still worth looking around
- <https://discord.gg/rust-lang-community> - this is where the user-community hangs out, lots of channels for particular interests (web dev, cli, async, security etc)
- Follow relevant people and orgs on twitter. I've made a list here: <https://twitter.com/i/lists/1651516734552121344/members>
