As I've joined the UK rust community it's not been super-clear to me how to join in online. So here's some resources to help you get stuck in.

- <https://www.rust-lang.org/community>
- <https://discord.gg/rust-lang> - this is more about contributing to the Rust language itself rather than just using it, but still worth looking around
- <https://discord.gg/rust-lang-community> - this is where the user-community hangs out, lots of channels for particular interests (web dev, cli, async, security etc)
- Follow relevant people and orgs on twitter. I've made a list here: <https://twitter.com/i/lists/1651516734552121344/members>
- The Rust Workshop has a private Discord community server for the community around the business and those generally interested in hacking on rust things in the business world. [Drop us an email for an invite](mailto:tim@rustworkshop.co?subject=Discord invite please&body=I'm interested because:) explaining your interest if you'd like to swing by. You can often find us hacking on interesting things, sharing resources we've found etc. If you'd like to become part of the business it's a good first step and any opportunities will go there first.
- <https://www.rust-lang.org/community> some of these, and more.
- The London meetup: <https://www.meetup.com/rust-london-user-group/>
- Rust Nation, the UK Rust conference: <https://www.rustnationuk.com/>
