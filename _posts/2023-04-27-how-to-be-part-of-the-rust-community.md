As I've joined the UK rust community it's not been super-clear to me how to join in online. So here's some resources to help you get stuck in.

<https://www.rust-lang.org/community> lists some of these, and more.

## Online

- <https://www.rust-lang.org/community>
- The [Official Rust Users Forum](https://users.rust-lang.org/)
- `#general` chat on [The Official Rust Zulip](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/122651-general)
- [reddit /r/rust](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/) - though note [the announcement intending to get off reddit](https://web.archive.org/web/20230612040007/https://old.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/146y5y1/announcement_rrust_will_be_joining_the_blackout/)

## Discord

- <https://discord.gg/rust-lang> - this is more about contributing to the Rust language itself rather than just using it, but still worth looking around
- <https://discord.gg/rust-lang-community> - this is where the user-community hangs out, lots of channels for particular interests (web dev, cli, async, security etc)
- The Rust Workshop has a Discord community server for the community around the business and those generally interested in hacking on rust things in the business world. To join use this [discord invite link](https://discord.gg/n65ZdtVZeE). You can often find us hacking on interesting things, sharing resources we've found etc. If you'd like to become part of the business it's a good first step and any opportunities will go there first.

## Social

- Follow relevant people and orgs on twitter. I've made a list here: <https://twitter.com/i/lists/1651516734552121344/members>

## IRL Meetup

- The London meetup: <https://www.meetup.com/rust-london-user-group/>
- Our very own meetup in Reading: <https://www.meetup.com/reading-rust-workshop/>
- Rust Nation, the UK Rust conference: <https://www.rustnationuk.com/>
