There's a thriving [London Rust meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Rust-London-User-Group/) already, but nothing for the Thames Valley.

Given the growing interest in Rust in the programming community and that Reading is a bit of a hub for technology businesses I've set up a meetup in Reading. To start with it's just laptop + pub + anyone that comes, and we'll see what it grows in to.

I plan to do this on the second Tuesday of every month.

ðŸ‘‰ Sign-up on meetup: [Meetup: Reading Rust Workshop](https://www.meetup.com/reading-rust-workshop/) to come along and be notified of new dates. ðŸ‘ˆ
