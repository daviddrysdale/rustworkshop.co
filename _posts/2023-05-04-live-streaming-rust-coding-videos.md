I've been doing a bit of live-streaming as I work on this presentation for "dependency injection in Rust". 

In order to show that the methods GPT came up with actually work, I'm working on a demo codebase here: <https://github.com/timabell/rust-dependency-injection-demo>. And because I can I've been livestreaming bits of it to twitch and youtube. You can follow me on twitch here <https://www.twitch.tv/tim_abell> to be notified of any new live streams (mobile app is good for that). And you can find recordings of previous streams at <https://www.youtube.com/@tim_abell/live>

Here's some of the recent videos:
